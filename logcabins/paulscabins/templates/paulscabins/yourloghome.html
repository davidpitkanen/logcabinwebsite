         <p>Many factors influence the planning of any log home. Your property will be a major
             consideration. We also encourage our clients to think about budget, lifestyle, needs and dreams.
             All come into play during the planning stage. The success of your design will be a marriage of these
             components.
         </p>

         <p>Often our clients come to us with their plans in hand. If this is not the case, we work through the process
             with the client to solidify their dreams and create custom plans. If required the services of an engineer
             are available through one of our trusted contacts.
         </p>
          <p>Services available from us include assistance formulating and fine tuning your plan into the home that not
              only is custom to you but that conforms to codes and other trades.
         </p>
          <p>
              We have had the pleasure of many years and many wonderful clients that have contributed to filling our
              repertoire with innovative and unique ideas and results. Sometimes the impossible just takes a little
              longer. We attempt to match your imagination to our abilities and are very receptive to challenges!
          </p>
          <p>
            Research into the company chosen to supply your needs is a mandatory facet of your
              successful build and we believe
              you will find our company to have both the skills and expertise.
